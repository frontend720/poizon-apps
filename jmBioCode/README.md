Welcome to JMBIOCODE!
This repository showcases my exploration of the fascinating intersection between JavaScript and Biology. Here, you'll find a collection of interactive learning tools, data-driven projects, and creative collaborations I've built during my journey.

My goal is to:

Learn and apply JavaScript coding skills in a biological context.
Develop interactive tools and visualizations to make biological concepts more accessible and engaging.
Contribute to the growing field of computational biology.
Feel free to browse through the projects, play around with the tools, and learn something new!
